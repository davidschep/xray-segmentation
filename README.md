# Automating the Segmentation of X-ray Images with Deep Neural Networks

## Introduction
The repository contains the code for creating the models used in the report. The data with which the models are trained on is not part of the repository.

## Data
Copy provided dataset to `dataset/` folder, so that it's ignored by git. Under this folder are the `data/` and `labels/` folders.

## Sources
We used the following two repositories as reference to the implementation that we did:

VGGNet: https://github.com/bnsreenu/python_for_microscopists/blob/master/194_xgboost_for_semantic_using_VGG_features.py
